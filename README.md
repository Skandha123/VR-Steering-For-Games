# VR-Steering-For-Games
A Python-based virtual input controller that transforms real-world steering movements (captured via webcam) into game controls. Built with OpenCV for hand/object tracking and PyAutoGUI/PyDirectInput for seamless input simulation, this project lets you play racing/driving games with custom motion controlsâ€”no VR headset required.
